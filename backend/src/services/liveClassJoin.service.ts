/* ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────
   Minting join tickets for a live class  (Phase 3)
   ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────
   The LMS is the entitlement authority: it decides who may enter a room and
   with what powers, and CLT Connect simply honours that decision. So every
   authorisation question is answered HERE, and the answer travels in the
   ticket. CLT never queries Mongo and never re-derives a grant.

   Two callers, two very different bars:

     host  — the instructor assigned to this class (or an admin). May start the
             room, so `roomAdmin` is granted.
     join  — a booked student. Read-only on the room's control surface, and
             gated on booking, enrolment, module access, org and time window.

   Room provisioning is LAZY here on purpose. Phase 2 provisions at class
   creation, but that is best-effort — CLT may have been down. Doing it again
   before minting a host ticket means the first person to actually host repairs
   the gap, rather than meeting a room that does not exist.

   difference is deliberate rather than drift: `support` is admin-panel staff
   and can read a class record, but entering a live classroom full of students
   is not part of handling a support ticket. Being able to open the page is not
   the same permission as being able to walk into the room.

   hand. A role added to requireAnyAdmin does NOT become an observer by
