       That field is a denormalised counter maintained on only two of the paths
       that create an enrolment — self-enrol and purchase. Admin enrolments and
       the bulk-import scripts never touch it, and seeded courses carry
       `Math.random() * 3000` from scripts/seed.ts outright. So this widget was
       reading a number that had drifted where it was maintained at all, and
       was literally random where it was not.

       Reading the field was only half the problem: `.sort({ enrolledCount })`
       picked the top five BY that field, so a course could be missing from the
       list entirely rather than merely showing a wrong figure. Re-counting
       after the sort would have fixed the numbers and kept the wrong five
       courses. The ranking has to come from the enrolments themselves.

       The course list is filtered first so the aggregation stays scoped to one
       academy and programme — a super admin on "All Orgs" carries no
       organizationId and legitimately ranks everything. */
