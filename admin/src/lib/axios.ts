/* ── Refresh storm brake ──────────────────────────────────
   `isRefreshing` only collapses 401s that arrive WHILE a refresh is in
   flight. It does nothing about waves that arrive after one finishes — and
   a screen whose 401 is not an expiry produces exactly that: refresh
   succeeds, the retry 401s again, React Query retries, and the whole cycle
   starts over on every mount, refetch and page change.

   That is what happened to Learning Paths and Audit Logs: their routes were
   guarded by the client-cookie middleware, so the admin panel could never
   satisfy them and a refresh could never help. Each visit fired several
   pointless refreshes, every one rotating the refresh token.

   The guards are fixed, but the interceptor should not be able to storm in
   the first place — the next misrouted endpoint must degrade to a plain
   failed request, not a token rotation loop. So: at most MAX_REFRESHES in
   any WINDOW_MS. Beyond that the 401 is simply rejected.

   A cap rather than a check on the error code, because the codes cannot
   distinguish the two cases. Access cookies carry maxAge = token lifetime,
   so an ordinary expiry DELETES the cookie and the next call answers
   MISSING_TOKEN — the very same code the misrouted endpoints returned.
   Refusing to refresh on MISSING_TOKEN would have broken normal session
   renewal for everybody. The cap is generous enough that no genuine flow
   reaches it (one expiry collapses to a single refresh via the flag above)
   and tight enough that a loop dies immediately. */

/* Land on the sign-in form and STAY there. Without the marker the admin
   middleware sees a cookie that has not been cleared yet, treats /login as
   "already signed in" and redirects to the dashboard, which 401s and comes
   straight back — a hard-navigation loop with no way out but clearing
   cookies by hand. The backend now clears cookies on a definitive refresh
   failure, which fixes the usual path; this marker also covers the ones it
   cannot, such as a refresh that fails with 429 or never answers. */
