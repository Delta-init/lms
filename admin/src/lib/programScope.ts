/* Which programme a member of staff is confined to.
 *
 * There used to be two ways to answer this. Three roles — `4x_admin`,
 * `digital_marketing_admin`, `ai_admin` — encoded the programme in the ROLE
 * NAME, while `sub_admin` carried it in a separate `program` field. They meant
 * the same thing, so the UI derived scope one way in some files and the other
 * way in others, and only the second could express JURA at all.
 *
 * The three role-encoded variants are gone; every scoped admin is now a
 * `sub_admin` whose programme lives in `program`. This module is the single
 * place that reads it, so the answer cannot differ between screens.
 *
 * Mirrors `injectCategoryScope` in backend/src/middleware/auth.middleware.ts —
 * the two must agree, because the backend enforces what this only displays.
