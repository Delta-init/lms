     session. Presence is all this middleware can check; validity is the
     API's answer, and when the two disagree this redirect is one half of an
     endless bounce: /login sees a cookie and sends you to the dashboard, the
     dashboard 401s and sends you back. Every hop is a full document
     navigation, so the browser appears to reload itself forever and the
     sign-in form is unreachable without clearing cookies by hand.

     ?session=expired is the client saying "I already know this cookie is
     dead" — honour it and show the form. It grants no access on its own:
     every page behind it is still gated by the cookie check below and by
     the API on each request. */
